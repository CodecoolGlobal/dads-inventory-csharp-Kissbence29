# Dad's inventory

In this project my task was to create an asp application with authentication and authorization.
You can check the AppDbContext.cs file to see how to login to the application. Also if you have a google account, you can sign in with that too.

# What I've learnt and deepen my knowledge in the following topics:

- Authentication
  - by cookie
  - by google Sign-in

- Authorization
  - by attribute
  - by modifying startup file

- Claims
- Secrets
